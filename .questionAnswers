1.	What is Git and what does it do?
    a.	Git is a version control software.
    This means that as you update and change a project, each version can be saved on Git.
    This way a user can see all the versions of their software and use these differing versions as needed to debug.
    Git is an open-source software which means it is free to use and edit.

2.	How is Github different from Git?
    a.	Github interacts with Git and is a collaboration website that hosts Git repositories.

3.	What is a branch? Why is it useful?
    a.	In a repository, every bit of code that is produced in this repository is on a master branch.
    Branching off this master branch is necessary because creating changes directly
    on the master branch is unfavorable. Branching creates a replica of the space you are branching
    from to make editing code safer and more forgiving.

4.	What is a commit?
    a.	A commit is when a change or a set of changes that a programmer makes to a project is saved and
    uploaded/pushed to the Github repository. This shows the project at the time of the commit.

5.	What is a pull request?
    a.	When commits are made, a pull request compares the changes between the original branch
    and the new code in the commit. Once these are reviewed and the differences are highlighted,
    the changes can be merged with the original branch of code.

6.	What is a fork? How would you find this to be useful?
    a.	A fork is when a person making a program makes a copy a repository under their personal GitHub account.
    This allows for edits to be made on code that a user does not have permission to edit.
    The user can then put in a pull request to merge this fork with the original code if the original
    programmer sees fit. This is the functioning of open-source collaboration.

7.	How do you clone a repository?
    a.	A clone of a repository is made when a user wants to develop a project locally,
    or not within the GitHub online network (whether it be on the application or a browser).
    When a clone is made, the entire repository and all the code within it is copied and downloaded to
    a local network such as a personal computer. All the changes made to this are only saved to the
    local network and to reintroduce these changes to the online GitHub repository,
    the changes would have to go through the commit and pull request process.
    To clone a repository, it can be done directly from GitHub, or you can use the following command
    in the command line:
            git clone https://github.com/username/repository
    where the link is the link to the repository that the user wishes to clone.

8.	How do you resolve merge conflicts?
    a.	A merge conflict is when there is a change in the same file on the same line in the two branches that are
    to be merged. To solve this the user can first run git status to know which file(s) these conflicts are
    occurring on. The file will then show with markers where the merge conflict is.
    To resolve this, the user must pick between the two versions that will be pushed to the branches
    that are being merged.
