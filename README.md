# MyRepo
assignment git and github

This task was making a GitHub repository and understanding how to push and pull changes onto it.

The GitHub repository was made using the GitHub desktop application and titled "MyRepo". Once this repository was created,
a branch named "TestBranch" was created to understand how to publish changes. On this branch, I finsihed the rest of this
assignment.

A video was watched to learn about some of the discrepencies involving Git and Github and I had to answer
questions about this video. Once these questions were answered, I opened a new text document in PyCharm and pasted these answers
into this document. Once this document was saved I used the following commands to commit it to my Remote
Github Repository:

git add <filename>
git commit

However Pycharm makes it so these commands do not have to be typed out.

The results should yieled the new file being uploaded online to the GitHub repository.
